    <h4 id = "nature" class = "quotes">"Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink...there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet is well as over our heads."<br>- Henry David Thoreau in <i>The Pond in Winter</i>, from <i>Walden</i>.<br>This quote connects to <b>Nature</b> because Thoreau is in his natural state in this new environment, surrounded by this natural beauty, living under his and only his authority.</h4>
    
    <h4 id = "inherentgoodness" class = "quotes">"You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,<br>But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br>And filter and fibre your blood."<br>- Walt Whitman in <i>Song of Myself</i>.<br>This quote connects to <b>Inherent Goodness of Humankind</b> because Whitman declares that, despite the reader being unknown to him, heâ€™ll still show kindness and help the reader.</h4>
    
    <h4 id = "intuition" class = "quotes">"What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br>And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br>They are alive and well somewhere,<br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,<br>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,<br>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd."<br>- Walt Whitman in <i>Song of Myself</i>.<br>This quote connects to <b>Intuition</b> because Whitman asks questions, then intuitively answers them symbolically, asserting that life never really stops, applying his logic as reasoning.</h4>
    
    <h4 id = "selfreliance" class = "quotes">"So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain with her, and gain all, and lost all, as her wheel rolls... A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable event, raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing you. Do not believe it."<br>- Ralph Waldo Emerson in <i>Self-Reliance</i>.<br>This quote connects to <b>Self Reliance</b> because Emerson indicates that Fortune and Lady Luck are entities separate from oneself.</h4>
    
    <h4 id = "nonconformity" class = "quotes">"A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight."<br>- Henry David Thoreau in <i>Civil Disobedience</i>.<br>This quote connects to <b>Non-Conformity</b> because he mentions that a minority that doesn't conform to the majority becomes a true force. By this, he means that by conforming, you are giving away your individual strength, especially when you are conforming to a cause you personally don't agree with. However, by using your individual power in tandem with others', you become an unavoidable obstacle, at least, to a majority.</h4>
